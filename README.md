**By Navin Shanmugam** | Electrical & Electronics Engineer  

### **Problem Statement**  
Traditional egg incubation methods often suffer from inconsistent temperature, humidity, and manual monitoring, leading to poor hatch rates. To address this, I designed **IncuCloud**: an open-source, IoT-enabled incubator that automates and optimizes the entire hatching process.  

### **Project Evolution**  
This project began as a bachelor‚Äôs thesis‚Äîa minimal IoT prototype with limited functionality. After years of iterative improvements, professional experience in embedded systems (at **VLS Automations**), and rigorous R&D (including custom PCB design and firmware optimization), IncuCloud now offers:  
- **Stable, crash-resistant operation** (tested for 1000+ hours).  
- **Automatic day-counting** and lockdown phase adjustments.  
- **Remote monitoring/control** via a cloud dashboard (Arduino IOT Could platform).

### **Why Open-Source?**  
To empower farmers, hobbyists, and engineers to:  
‚úÖ Build affordable, high-efficiency incubators.  
‚úÖ Adapt designs to local needs (e.g., power constraints, bird species).  
‚úÖ Learn embedded systems through practical agricultural tech.

### **Features** üåü  
- **Auto Day Tracking**: Adjusts parameters for lockdown phases automatically.  
- **IoT Integration**: Real-time alerts and remote control via web/mobile (arduino cloud platform).
- **Auto Mode**: Pre-Saved Profiles: Optimized presets for chickens, quails , ducks , and turkeys .
- **Lockdown Automation**: Auto-adjusts humidity and stops rotation in the final lockdown days of each Preset.
- **Manual Mode**: Fully customizable temperature, humidity, hatching days, lockdown day and rotation intervals.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track temperature, humidity, and rotation via a dashboard.  
- **Remote Control**: Adjust settings from anywhere using a mobile app or web interface.  
- **Data Logging**: Export historical incubation data to CSV or cloud storage.

## Setup Guide üíª  
### Prerequisites for Uploading the Program
- Arduino IDE (for ESP32 firmware).
- kiCAD for PCB and Schematic.

### Modular PCB Design üõ†Ô∏è 
The IncuCloud hardware is built around a removable modular PCB system, designed for easy troubleshooting and component replacement.(can't build the PCB perfectly due to less availability have to do some tweeks and fixes)

### Key Features


‚úÖ Hot-Swappable Modules: Replace faulty components (e.g., sensors, motor drivers) without soldering.
‚úÖ Standard Connectors: JST-XH and screw terminals for quick disconnects.
‚úÖ Open Design: All KiCad files and Gerbers provided for customization.


### Download Design Files:

Schematics PDF

Gerber Files

3D Model

Order PCBs:

Upload the Gerber files to a PCB manufacturer (e.g., JLCPCB, PCBWay).

Use the BOM to source components from LCSC or local suppliers.

Assemble Modules:

Follow the assembly guide.

Use low-temperature solder for connectors to avoid damaging replaceable modules.
